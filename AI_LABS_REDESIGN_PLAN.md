# AI Labs Section Redesign Plan

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Goal**: Transform the current AI Labs section into an interactive, engaging showcase inspired by Linear.app and Framer.com with lightning theme.

**Previous Status**: Static demo components with simulated functionality
**Current Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Fully functional interactive AI playground with real backend integration
**Achievement**: Dynamic, interactive AI playground with Supabase backend and GPT-5-nano integration

---

## 📋 Design Requirements

### Core Principles
- **Mobile-First Design**: Seamless experience from phones to desktop
- **Lightning Theme Integration**: Electric animations and visual effects throughout
- **Interactive Demonstrations**: Users can actually try AI features, not just read about them
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Hero → Quick Demo → Deep Dive → Analytics flow
- **Honest Demo Constraints**: Transparent about frontend limitations while showcasing capabilities

### Visual Inspiration
- **Linear.app**: Clean hierarchy, smooth interactions, professional feel
- **Framer.com**: Interactive demos with "wow factor", compelling animations
- **Lightning Theme**: Energetic micro-interactions, electric data flow effects

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Strategy

### 1. Frontend-Only Rate Limiting System

**Approach**: Session-based tracking with localStorage persistence
- **Session Limits**: 10 questions per browser session (resets on close)
- **Weekly Limits**: 3 document uploads per week (localStorage tracking)
- **Visual Feedback**: Progress bars, counters, and usage analytics
- **Reset Mechanisms**: Clear demo reset options for testing
- **Honest Messaging**: "Demo constraints" vs real backend limitations

**Storage Strategy**:
```typescript
// Session Storage (resets on browser close)
- aiChatQuestions: number (0-10)
- currentSession: timestamp
- sessionActive: boolean

// Local Storage (persists between sessions)
- weeklyUploads: { count: number, weekStart: timestamp }
- totalInteractions: number
- lastVisit: timestamp
```

### 2. Mobile-First Layout Architecture

**Responsive Breakpoints**:
- Mobile: 320px - 768px (primary design target)
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px (enhanced interactions)
- Desktop: 1024px+ (side-by-side layouts)

**Layout Strategy**:
- **Stacked Components**: Vertical flow for mobile, adaptive grid for larger screens
- **Swipeable Interfaces**: Touch-friendly navigation between AI features
- **Large Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for all interactive elements
- **Thumb-Reachable**: Critical controls within 75% of screen height
