## 🎯 Blueprint Compliance

This release addresses the critical gap identified between the impressive blueprint vision and the previous implementation:

### ✅ Resolved Discrepancies
- **Missing pre-build command** → Now implemented with proper validation
- **Incomplete mobile navigation** → Professional hamburger menu with accessibility
- **Missing interactive features** → Smooth scrolling, form validation, error handling
- **Performance concerns** → Lazy loading, Suspense boundaries, GPU acceleration
- **Accessibility issues** → Full keyboard navigation, screen reader support, reduced motion
- **Content vs blueprint mismatches** → GitHub URL fixed, placeholder content removed

### 🎨 Professional Features Now Match Claims
- **AI-powered development efficiency** demonstrated through modern tooling and performance
- **Professional quality** evident in error handling, accessibility, and user experience
- **Small business focus** reflected in comprehensive contact form and professional presentation
- **Modern tech stack** properly leveraged with Next.js 15, React 19, and TypeScript
