## üë®‚Äçüíª **2. ABOUT ME SECTION** ‚úÖ *COMPLETE*

**After eight years in customer service and technical support, I learned something crucial: every business struggle comes down to connecting with customers and streamlining processes.**

Freelancing taught me the other side of the equation: how to find clients, build relationships, and deliver real value. I learned that successful projects aren't just about technical skills‚Äîthey're about understanding business needs and solving actual problems.

**My creative background in video editing with Adobe Creative Suite developed my eye for design and storytelling**‚Äîskills that now shape how I approach UI/UX and digital product design. I believe great software isn't just functional; it's intuitive and engaging.

**Today, as an OFW working in a Korean factory by day, I code by night.** While working full-time, I dedicate my evenings (9 PM - 1 AM) and weekends to mastering AI-powered development tools like Cursor IDE and Claude Code CLI, building real solutions for businesses. Working full-time and coding after long shifts means every hour counts ‚Äî that's why I use cutting-edge AI development tools not just as assistants, but as development partners to build websites, mobile apps, and automation solutions faster and smarter than traditional methods.

**Every project I deliver comes from pure determination and the efficiency of AI-powered development.** My goal is to transition to full-time software development when the right opportunity comes, but for now, I'm proving my skills one evening project at a time.

**My mission is clear:** Transform the customer service and operational challenges I once solved manually into scalable, AI-powered solutions. Whether it's automating lead generation, streamlining customer workflows, or building intelligent systems that grow with your business‚ÄîI bridge the gap between knowing what businesses need and building what actually works.

**Always learning. Always building. Always focused on results that matter to your bottom line.**

**Current Availability:**

- **Weekdays:** 9 PM - 1 AM (Korean Time)
- **Weekends:** Mostly full days (Sundays always available)
- **Communication:** Quick responses via email/chat during work breaks

## üìä **4. FEATURED PROJECT CASE STUDY** ‚úÖ *COMPLETE*

### [**gracekimkor.com](http://gracekimkor.com): Building a Professional Financial Platform After Factory Shifts**

**Client:** Grace Kim, Licensed Samsung Financial Consultant

**Challenge:** Needed credible online presence for complex financial services

**Timeline:** 7 days total (5 days planning, 2 days building)

**My Reality:** Built entirely during evenings after 12-hour factory shifts

### **The Challenge**

Grace Kim needed more than a simple website. As a licensed Samsung financial consultant in South Korea, she needed an **interactive platform** that could:

- Showcase multiple Samsung financial products (cards, insurance, investments)
- Guide different visa types to appropriate services
- Build trust and credibility in a regulated financial industry
- Convert visitors into consultation requests

### **The Reality Check**

This was my first live client project, and I was working around a full-time factory schedule. After 12-hour shifts, I had maybe 4-5 hours of focused coding time per evening. The planning phase took 5 evenings ‚Äî understanding her business, mapping user journeys, and designing the information architecture.

### **The AI-Powered Solution**

Working with limited time meant I needed to be incredibly efficient. Here's how AI assistance made the impossible possible:

**Technology Stack:**

- Next.js 15 with Turbopack (cutting-edge performance)
- TypeScript for reliability
- Tailwind CSS + ShadCN for rapid UI development
- Radix UI for accessible components
- Vercel for lightning-fast deployment

**AI Development Approach:**

- **Planning:** AI helped structure complex financial product information
- **Code Development:** Cursor IDE + Claude Code CLI for AI-assisted coding
- **Problem Solving:** Instant solutions for technical challenges with AI pair programming
- **Quality Assurance:** AI helped catch bugs and optimize performance during tired evening coding

### **Interactive Features Built**

- **Visa Type Filtering:** Dynamic service recommendations based on user's visa status
- **Service Matching:** Personalized insurance and financial product suggestions
- **Multi-Channel Contact:** Integrated KakaoTalk, phone, email, and consultation forms
- **Professional Credibility:** Clear licensing information and office details
- **Testimonial Gallery:** Interactive showcase of client consultation screenshots with professional presentation
- **Mobile Optimization:** Perfect experience across all Korean mobile carriers

### **Design Challenge: Making "Ugly" Screenshots Look Professional**

Grace wanted to show proof of her client consultations, but the raw screenshots had scribbles, annotations, and looked unprofessional. **The challenge:** How do you display authentic client proof while maintaining a polished, credible website?

**My solution:** Created an interactive testimonial component that:

- Frames rough screenshots in clean, professional containers
- Adds proper spacing and visual hierarchy
- Uses subtle shadows and borders to elevate the presentation
- Organizes multiple screenshots into an easy-to-browse gallery
- Maintains authenticity while ensuring professional appearance

**Result:** Grace can showcase genuine client interactions without compromising her professional image - turning a potential design weakness into a trust-building strength.

### **The Results**

‚úÖ **Professional Credibility:** Grace reports clients are more confident in her services

‚úÖ **Better Client Feedback:** Website demonstrates her legitimacy and expertise

‚úÖ **Business Validation:** Interactive platform positions her above competitors

‚úÖ **Technical Success:** Fast loading, mobile-optimized, accessible to all users

‚úÖ **Personal Achievement:** Proved I could deliver enterprise-quality work as a solo evening developer

### **What This Proves**

**For other SMB clients:** If I can build a professional financial services platform for a licensed consultant while working factory shifts, imagine what I can do for your business needs.

**AI-powered efficiency means:** You get professional results without corporate overhead or traditional development timelines.
