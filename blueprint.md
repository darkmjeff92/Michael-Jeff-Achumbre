- **Approach:** Intentionally minimal background for readability and focus
- **Visual:** Clean card-based layout with subtle hover effects
- **Design Philosophy:** Content-first approach allows story to shine without distractions
- **Accessibility:** High contrast text on subtle backgrounds for optimal readability

**My background includes diverse professional experience that shaped my development approach.** Eight years in customer service and various roles taught me something crucial: every problem comes down to connecting with people and solving real challenges. This foundation, combined with early tech studies, developed my analytical and user-focused perspective.

Freelancing taught me the other side of the equation: how to find clients, build relationships, and deliver real value. I learned that successful projects aren't just about technical skills‚Äîthey're about understanding business needs and solving actual problems.

**My creative background in video editing with Adobe Creative Suite developed my eye for design and storytelling**‚Äîskills that now shape how I approach UI/UX and digital product design. I believe great software isn't just functional; it's intuitive and engaging.

**Then came June 2025 - the discovery that changed everything.** While exploring digital opportunities, I discovered modern development paradigms through comprehensive online learning resources. That moment of realization sparked an intensive focus on mastering AI-enhanced development workflows. Every available hour became dedicated to strategic skill advancement.

**Today, I'm advancing development capabilities while working overseas.** Currently transitioning to full-time development while optimizing every coding session through strategic use of AI-enhanced development tools and modern platforms, treating them as intelligent collaborators that amplify productivity and code quality.

**My first client project, gracekimkor.com, proved what's possible.** Built with focused development sessions and strategic AI leverage, this successful delivery demonstrated the effectiveness of modern development approaches.

**The goal is clear:** Transition to full-time software development through proven skills and real projects. Every evening of coding, every problem solved, every line of code - it's all building toward that future.

## üöÄ **4. PROJECTS SECTION** - *Built with Lightning Speed*

### [**gracekimkor.com](http://gracekimkor.com): My First Client Success - Proving Skills Through Real Projects**

**Client:** Grace Kim, Licensed Samsung Financial Consultant

**Challenge:** Needed credible online presence for complex financial services

**Timeline:** 7 days total (5 days planning, 2 days building)

**My Reality:** Built entirely during evenings after 12-hour factory shifts

### **The Challenge**

Grace Kim needed more than a simple website. As a licensed Samsung financial consultant in South Korea, she needed an **interactive platform** that could:

- Showcase multiple Samsung financial products (cards, insurance, investments)
- Guide different visa types to appropriate services
- Build trust and credibility in a regulated financial industry
- Convert visitors into consultation requests

### **The Reality Check**

This was my first live client project, and I was working around a full-time factory schedule. After 12-hour shifts, I had maybe 4-5 hours of focused coding time per evening. The planning phase took 5 evenings ‚Äî understanding her business, mapping user journeys, and designing the information architecture.

### **The AI-Powered Solution**

Working with limited time meant I needed to be incredibly efficient. Here's how AI assistance made the impossible possible:

**Technology Stack:**

- Next.js 15 with Turbopack (cutting-edge performance)
- TypeScript for reliability
- Tailwind CSS + ShadCN for rapid UI development
- Radix UI for accessible components
- Vercel for lightning-fast deployment

**AI Development Approach:**

- **Planning:** AI helped structure complex financial product information
- **Code Development:** Cursor IDE + Claude Code CLI for AI-assisted coding
- **Problem Solving:** Instant solutions for technical challenges with AI pair programming
- **Quality Assurance:** AI helped catch bugs and optimize performance during tired evening coding

### **Interactive Features Built**

- **Visa Type Filtering:** Dynamic service recommendations based on user's visa status
- **Service Matching:** Personalized insurance and financial product suggestions
- **Multi-Channel Contact:** Integrated KakaoTalk, phone, email, and consultation forms
- **Professional Credibility:** Clear licensing information and office details
- **Testimonial Gallery:** Interactive showcase of client consultation screenshots with professional presentation
- **Mobile Optimization:** Perfect experience across all Korean mobile carriers

### **Design Challenge: Making "Ugly" Screenshots Look Professional**

Grace wanted to show proof of her client consultations, but the raw screenshots had scribbles, annotations, and looked unprofessional. **The challenge:** How do you display authentic client proof while maintaining a polished, credible website?

**My solution:** Created an interactive testimonial component that:

- Frames rough screenshots in clean, professional containers
- Adds proper spacing and visual hierarchy
- Uses subtle shadows and borders to elevate the presentation
- Organizes multiple screenshots into an easy-to-browse gallery
- Maintains authenticity while ensuring professional appearance

**Result:** Grace can showcase genuine client interactions without compromising her professional image - turning a potential design weakness into a trust-building strength.

### **The Results**

‚úÖ **Professional Credibility:** Grace reports clients are more confident in her services

‚úÖ **Better Client Feedback:** Website demonstrates her legitimacy and expertise

‚úÖ **Business Validation:** Interactive platform positions her above competitors

‚úÖ **Technical Success:** Fast loading, mobile-optimized, accessible to all users

‚úÖ **Personal Achievement:** Proved I could deliver enterprise-quality work as a solo evening developer

### **What This Proves**

**For other SMB clients:** If I can build a professional financial services platform for a licensed consultant while working factory shifts, imagine what I can do for your business needs.

**AI-powered efficiency means:** You get professional results without corporate overhead or traditional development timelines.
