    story: "After eight years in customer service and technical support, I learned something crucial: every business struggle comes down to connecting with customers and streamlining processes. Freelancing taught me the other side of the equation: how to find clients, build relationships, and deliver real value. I learned that successful projects aren't just about technical skills‚Äîthey're about understanding business needs and solving actual problems. My creative background in video editing with Adobe Creative Suite developed my eye for design and storytelling‚Äîskills that now shape how I approach UI/UX and digital product design. I believe great software isn't just functional; it's intuitive and engaging.",
    mission: "Today, as an OFW working in a Korean factory by day, I code by night. While working full-time, I dedicate my evenings (9 PM - 1 AM) and weekends to mastering AI-powered development tools like Cursor IDE and Claude Code CLI, building real solutions for businesses. Working full-time and coding after long shifts means every hour counts ‚Äî that's why I use cutting-edge AI development tools not just as assistants, but as development partners to build websites, mobile apps, and automation solutions faster and smarter than traditional methods. Every project I deliver comes from pure determination and the efficiency of AI-powered development. My goal is to transition to full-time software development when the right opportunity comes, but for now, I'm proving my skills one evening project at a time. My mission is clear: Transform the customer service and operational challenges I once solved manually into scalable, AI-powered solutions. Whether it's automating lead generation, streamlining customer workflows, or building intelligent systems that grow with your business‚ÄîI bridge the gap between knowing what businesses need and building what actually works. Always learning. Always building. Always focused on results that matter to your bottom line.",
