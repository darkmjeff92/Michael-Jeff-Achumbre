# Portfolio Positioning Guidelines

## Core Identity: Authentic Capability Demonstration

### Primary Title: "AI-Powered Developer"
**Strategic Rationale:** Shows real AI integration capabilities without claiming false expertise

### Authentic Capability Framework
- **What you've built:** Web applications, mobile solutions, AI automations (with real examples)
- **How you build:** Using cutting-edge development tools and AI-enhanced workflows (demonstrated live)
- **Your demonstration:** Interactive AI showcase proving capabilities through hands-on experience
- **Portfolio purpose:** AI demo/showcase rather than expert professional pitch

## Content Strategy Rules

### ✅ DO Emphasize:
1. **Real project demonstrations** over capability claims
2. **Interactive AI showcases** that visitors can experience directly
3. **"Here's what I've built"** rather than "here's what I can do"
4. **Proven results** (gracekimkor.com success, live demos)
5. **Authentic development journey** through hands-on projects
6. **AI tools as development accelerators** shown through real implementations
7. **Portfolio as AI demo/showcase** rather than business pitch

### ❌ DON'T Emphasize:
1. **False expertise claims** or overstated professional credentials
2. **"Mastered" or "expert" language** when showing recent learning
3. **Business pitch approach** - avoid "hire me" positioning
4. **Capability claims without demonstrations** - show, don't just tell
5. **Professional qualifications** that overstate experience level
6. **Advanced skill claims** without interactive proof
7. **Traditional portfolio approaches** - this is an AI showcase, not resume
